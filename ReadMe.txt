The sub directory matlab_scripts contains 3 matlab files which generate the figures (2,3 and 4) in the manuscript, with names which are self evident. They use data files stored in the directory called data_files.
The only two actions which should be needed to run these three files are
(1) Change the Directory_pop in all mfiles to a local directory where the data files are stored.
(2) Copy the file analysing_flux_detection_data_combination_function_for_sharing.m to the same directory as it is being used by the figure creation mfiles.
